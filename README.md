# CompBioProject

This is my Computational Systems Biology final project. I wanted to create a search engine for biological and chemical databases that
rank the sources on more scientific based criteria (literature citations/database references/total data fields). A security token for
accessing the ChemSpider API is needed (registration at their website) and then running the Main.py will perform the searching and ranking,
provided that all files are in same directory.
